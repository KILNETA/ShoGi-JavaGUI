# Introduction  
This is a complete ShoGi game, which includes the login interface.  
  
# Inspiration  
Since most of the previous programming was based on displaying the program results in the "editor" or "Cmd", this made me curious about how to implement a graphical interface program and apply it to practical applications so that it has certain functions.
